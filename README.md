# Django in one file Demo
This project explores the ideas of having an entire [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project in a single file, internally the result will be a Django project but externally it will be more like a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) project. 

It's initially based around [this repos](https://github.com/radiac/nanodjango).
